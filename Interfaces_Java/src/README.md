## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Abstract classes and abstract methods  
- Concrete methods inside abstract classes  
- Using inheritance with abstract classes  
- Creating and implementing interfaces  
- Interface inheritance  
- Implementing multiple interfaces in one class  
- Runtime polymorphism using interfaces  
- Interface reference limitations  
- Default methods in interfaces  
- Static methods in interfaces

## 💻 Practice Summary
I completed multiple problems related to abstraction, interfaces, and polymorphic behavior in Java.  
Each example focuses on applying core OOP concepts and understanding how abstraction improves code structure and flexibility.

Every `.java` file includes a short problem description followed by the working code.
